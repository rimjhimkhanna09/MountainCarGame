# MountainCarGame
In the MountainCar environment, a car starts at the bottom of a valley. The agent must learn to drive up a steep hill to reach the flag. Since the carâ€™s engine is not powerful enough to climb the hill directly, it must first build momentum by driving back and forth. The car's engine isn't powerful enough to drive directly up the hill.
